Abstract<br/>
The project is based on design of robotic framework with C++ as programming
language. The application contains a **server and client network** connecting a robot
and workstation. The server sends data to the connected clients like sensor
parameters. The server section manages password for **security access, camera
display and serial communication for sensors.** The client displays and monitors the
data from the other end. <br/>
