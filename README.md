Abstract<b/>
The project is based on design of robotic framework with C++ as programming
language. The application contains a <strong>server and client network</strong> connecting a robot
and workstation. The server sends data to the connected clients like sensor
parameters. The server section manages password for <strong>security access, camera
display and serial communication for sensors.</strong> The client displays and monitors the
data from the other end.
